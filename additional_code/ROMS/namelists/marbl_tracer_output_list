  ! This text file specifies the list of MARBL tracers you would like to write to
  ! the BGC output file. Add the short name of one tracer variable per line. 
  ! Comments should be written on their own line. Comment lines and unrecognised
  ! tracer variable names will be ignored. If this file contains no recognised
  ! tracers, or does not exist, ROMS will default to writing ALL MARBL tracers to
  ! the output file.
  ! To see a list of available tracers, either run without editing this file or
  ! use
  ! $MARBL_ROOT/tests/regression_tests/requested_tracers/requested_tracers.py
